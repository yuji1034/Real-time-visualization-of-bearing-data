本项目仅通过HTML， CSS， JS以及Echarts可视化组件实现。
 
This project is implemented only through HTML, CSS, JS and Echarts visualization components.



介绍：如图，六个图分别对应不同的轴承数据，当然也可以是任何数据，以折线图形式显示。右上角的四个灯分别显示不同的结果（这里表示故障类型，若亮红灯则表示故障。这个结果为后端传参），这是可自定义的。旁边按钮的功能分别为向后端发送故障数据用于记录以及查看此记录。

Introduce: As shown in the figure, the six graphs correspond to different bearing data, of course, any data can be displayed in the form of a line graph. The four lights in the upper right corner show different results (here it indicates the fault type, if the red light is on, it means a fault.This result is the backend parameter), which is customizable.The functions of the buttons next to it are to send fault data to the backend for recording and to view the records.




精简，适合新手。当然这也是我作为新手时的作品，是我人生中第一个完成的作品。在一年后对我来说已经十分简单，甚至很多地方过于冗余。但是我在上传时并没有选择优化，这是我的来时路，值得我铭记。当然优化工作其实也很简单。

Streamlined, suitable for beginners. Of course, this is also my work when I was a beginner, and it is the first completed work in my life.After a year, it has become very simple for me, even too redundant in many places. But I did not choose to optimize when uploading. This is my way of coming, and it is worth remembering.Of course, optimization is also very simple.
